# shine-varying

**FRP interface for [`shine`](https://github.com/fgaz/shine) in terms of [`Var`s](https://github.com/schell/varying)**

This package exports a function that lets you control shine's
functionality through a `Var` that maps from inputs to a `Picture`
plus a bunch of utility `Var`s, like the current time and the
keypresses.

**demo** (compiled tests) [here](http://fgaz.me/shine-varying/tests)
